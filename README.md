# Speech-Recognition
a program that can recognize basic spoken commands or words. Use a pretrained model or a basic algorithm for speech recognition.
# Simple Speech Recognition Tool
This project aims to build a simple speech recognition tool capable of recognizing basic spoken commands or words. The program utilizes a pre-trained model or a basic algorithm for speech recognition, implemented in Python.

# Technologies Used
Python
SpeechRecognition library
Other libraries as necessary
Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install SpeechRecognition
Optionally, install additional dependencies for audio recording/playback:
pip install pyaudio
Note: Installing pyaudio might require additional system-level installations, especially on Linux systems.

# Usage
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the main script to start the speech recognition tool:
The program will prompt you to speak a command or word.
Speak clearly into your microphone.
The program will recognize and display the spoken command or word.

# Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:
Basic Speech Recognition.py: Main script to execute the speech recognition tool.
README.md: Documentation providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guide, etc.

# Contributing
Contributions to improve the speech recognition tool are welcome. You can contribute by:

Implementing additional features such as support for multiple languages, advanced commands, etc.
Improving the accuracy and efficiency of speech recognition algorithms.
Enhancing the user interface and experience.
Please follow the standard GitHub workflow for contributing: Fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request.
